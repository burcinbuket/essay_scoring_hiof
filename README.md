# Essay Scoring with Siamese Networks

This project explores automated essay scoring using Siamese Neural Networks. It is developed as part of a machine learning experiment to compare textual similarity and performance in scoring student essays.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Pycodes/`: Python scripts for training and evaluating the models
- `Dataset/`: Ignored in version control due to large file size (~50 GB)
- `Outputs/`: Saved model results, figures, predictions, etc.
- `condaEnvironments/`: Environment configuration file for reproducibility

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

To replicate the exact conda environment used in this project:

```bash
conda env create -f condaEnvironments/ml_duplicate_env.yml
